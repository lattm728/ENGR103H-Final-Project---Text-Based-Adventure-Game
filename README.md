# ENGR103H-Final-Project---Text-Based-Adventure-Game
Hi, and welcome to my game!
This is a text-based adventure game that utilizes the serial monitor and the Circuit Playground's buttons and switch in order to select dialogue or other options.
This game is based off of SAM & MAX, a series of comics (and a video game series!) created by Steve Purcell.
All of the characters are his property, so technically I don't have the legal rights to this creative property. 
(I thought the idea was fun, anyway.)

Please note that the game will take a minute to upload. If you didn't see, there's ~1500 lines of code here, so that's why.
The game will explain this, but for future reference:
Face the cord input on the board at the top of the board, or away from you. If the switch is to the left, then
the left and right button correspond to options A and B. If the switch is to the right, then the left and right buttons correspond
to C and D. If it seems like you're pressing the wrong option, try flipping the board around. 
The word "reset" in the center of the board should be right side up, and if you flip the board around, then all of the titles and words
should also be right side up.

Good luck and have fun!
